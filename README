A munin plugin to monitor cloudatcost accounts using the API.

- resources available/consumed
- VM utilisation

Well, that must be one the shorter projects I've started..  Step one of their
API docs is to generate an API KEY, however that is not working ...

Status:  Paused, waiting for cloudatcost to suck less
