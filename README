The start of a set of perl bindings for the cloudatcost API.

NOTE: These APIs have been "disabled" since June 2017.  At the time they said
that they were shortly to replease a new API.  Since this never occured, this
library is now mostly useless.

API Documentation:
    https://panel.cloudatcost.com/api-details.php

NOTE: generating the API key didnt work for me on firefox, but does on chromium.

Was intended to provide a munin monitor with:

- resources available/consumed
- VM utilisation
